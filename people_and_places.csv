            Part of a Roman brick , with furrows on one side of
              it, of this sort are all ye Key bricks of ye
              arches over ye loop- holes of ye Roman
              pharos in Dover castle: this seems to have been a singular
              contrivance to let in ye sand & stones mixt with ye mortar while liquid, wch would
              insinuate itself, & ye Stones would lodge in these
              furrows & keep ye bricks at a proper distance spreading
              at top to form an arch. The pharos hath been pulled, or tumbled half down
              & a church now without a roof hath been built adjoining to it, to wch it served as a Steep le & Bellferry, till
                  Sr. George Rook obtain'd bare to

              Natives ye Devills bit upon an hill South West of the castle on ye other side

                ye sea & may be seen beyond ye point at

              hill indeed but at ye bottom of a Bay, wch forms ye Harbour of Dover, & truly ye Remains of those Stones
              seem only to have been ye bottom of a pillar,wch might serve as a Land mark in ye Day time; or
